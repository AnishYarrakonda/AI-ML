# AI/ML

This folder contains machine learning learning projects and notes, mainly in notebooks.

## Contents
- `Basic ML Libraries/`
  - NumPy notebooks and sample data
  - Pandas notebooks and sample data
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn notebooks and datasets
- `PyTorch Course/`
  - PyTorch fundamentals, workflow, classification, and computer vision notebooks
  - `helper_functions.py` and saved model files in `models/`
- `making_ai_from_scratch/`
  - Additional from-scratch AI experiments
- `practice.ipynb`

## Getting started
1. Create/activate a Python environment.
2. Install notebook dependencies as needed (for example: `jupyter`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `torch`).
3. Open notebooks from this folder.

## Typical usage
- Launch Jupyter from `ai_ml/` and run notebooks in order.
- Use the PyTorch notebooks with `helper_functions.py` and model checkpoints in `PyTorch Course/models/`.
